1.5 Frequently Asked Questions
1.	 What is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an open, blockchain‑based system of financial protocols and applications that lets anyone lend, borrow, trade, and earn yield—without traditional intermediaries.
2.	 What are the benefits of DeFi?
• Financial Freedom: Access banking‑like services from anywhere.
• Crystal‑Clear Transparency: Every transaction and smart contract is on‑chain and auditable.
• Programmable Money: Automate loans, swaps, staking—no middlemen, just code.
• Composable Innovation: Mix ‘n’ match protocols to invent entirely new products.
• Lean & Mean: Peer‑to‑peer transactions slash fees.
3.	 Why does DeFi challenge traditional regulation?
Instead of a single bank or broker, DeFi runs on global, permissionless code. Regulators must shift from entity‑centric rules to overseeing open, self‑enforcing protocols.
4.	 What is DeFi not?
• Not a centralized service “hosted” on blockchain.
• Not pure token gambling—real utility underpins the protocols.
• Not lawless: smart contracts encode governance and safety checks.
• Not a magic bullet for all financial woes.

India has the most foreign remittance,
